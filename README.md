#Test Requirements

Demo: http://donsro.atwebpages.com/sandbox/tabs

<ol>

	<li><strong>Build a responsive ‘class=“container”’ div that’ll hold a tab module</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>The div container should have a width of 980 pixels and auto centers when the browser window is wider than 980 pixels.</li>
			<li>The div container should be responsive when the browser window is narrower than 980 pixels.</li>
			<li>Please give the container a top padding of 100px.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
	</li>
 
	<li><strong>Build a responsive tab/tab-content module</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>The tab module should have three navigation tabs</li>
			<li>The tab module should have three tabs-content areas (each associated with its respective tab nav item)</li>
			<li>The end user should be able to click/touch between the tabs and the tab content will change.</li>
			<li>The module should be built with the mindset that the number of tabs (and therefore, the tab content) will be vary in range.  It could be two tabs or it could be 5 tabs.</li>
			<li>This module should be responsive and on mobile view, it transforms into an accordion.</li>
			<li>The tab title and tab content can be “lorem ipsum”.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
	</li>
 
	<li><strong>Build a hash-bang-slash (i.e. “#!/“) URL navigation system.</strong>	
		<ul>
			<li>This is related to the tab module.</li>
			<li>When a user clicks on a tab, the URL updates. For instance, perhaps the user enters the website via ‘http://www.website.com/’ and when they click on the first tab, the URL updates to ‘http:// www.website.com/#!/tab1’.</li>
			<li>The module should be built with the mindset that the number of tabs will be variable (i.e. the back-end team can add more tabs and the navigation still works)</li>
			<li>The URL should have accessible names, like the title of the tab rather than a generic “tab1”, “tab2”, “tab3”, etc.</li>
			<li>The URL , should it have a hash-bang-slash, should trigger that particular tab and show it’s respective tab-content.  For instance, when a user first enters the website by copying and pasting the link: ‘http:// www.website.com/#!/tab3’, the third tab in the tab module should trigger, it’s content shown, and the page should scroll down.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
	</li>
 
	<li><strong>In tab content area of the first tab, build me a responsive carousel.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>The carousel should have 4 carousel items per view.</li>
			<li>The carousel should have 11 items total.</li>
			<li>Each carousel item should have a title, placeholder image (pick your favorite LOLCATs images from google), and a button stacked vertically inside it.</li>
			<li>The carousel should have left and right buttons to move the carousel forward or backwards.</li>
			<li>The carousel should have pagination that’s clickable to navigate along with an active state.</li>
			<li>The carousel should be responsive.</li>		
		</ul>
